Trading Position Size as per Risk 

No BS, its just a calculator which only divide the risk per trade value by the stoploss amount.
like, if your risk per trade is 500 and the stoploss is 10 then the position size will be 50 (500/10=50).
but you'll be thinking, wait minuit a basic calculator should do it, right. And the answer is yes, it will
not only that you can also do it in your head, so waht's the purpose ?, you ask. 

When taking a trade (talking about daytrading), sometime you have to fast to enter or the opportunity can be 
missed and a simple task like opening a calculator then enter the risk amount and divide  it with the stoploss 
can be a wholesome task, that's where 'sizzer' comes handy you just enter the stoploss amount and hit enter, Voil√†!
and you can focus on taking and managing the trade.
